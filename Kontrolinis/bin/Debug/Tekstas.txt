But I must explain!! to you how.. all this !!!mistaken1001,,,, idea101
of101 denouncing ,,pleasure and praising p,ain was born101 and 
I will give you a complet1e account,, of the system, and
 expou0nd the actual teach1ings of the great exp,lorer 0f 
the tr0uth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one 
rejec0ts, dislikes, or avo1ids pleasure itse,lf, because it 
is pl0easure, but because those who do not know how to pursue 
pleas0ure rationally encou1nte, consequences that are extrem,ely 
pain0ful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues 
or des0ires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, 
but beca0use occasionally circumstances occ,ur in which 
toil and pain can procure him so,me great pleasure. 
To take a triv,ial example, which of us ever undertakes 
laborious physi,cal exercise, except to obtain some 
adva,ntage fro,m it? But 
who has any right to find.. fault with a man who chooses 
to en,joy a pleasure that has no annoying conse,quences, 
or one who avoi,ds a pain that produces no res,ultant pleasure?
